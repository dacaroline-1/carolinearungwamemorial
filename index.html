        <h2> BIOGRAPHY OF LATE SISTER CAROLINE M. ARUNGWA</h2>
        <p>
            
            Caroline M. Arungwa {nee- Caroline Johnson}, 70, passed away after a protracted illness. It’s true that we do often avoid talking about death because we don’t like to face the finality of it. When death strike mortals, we ask questions. We wonder in awe and ask how did it happen? It is the Lord’s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.  Pages will not suffice to describe the life and time of this great icon. She was of great service to God and humanity. She reflects the virtues and standards that should be seen in the lives of people of God. Many have asked what is the purpose of life? And others why are we here on Earth today? However, most people demand to know where we come from? And where we are going? Our departed matriarch, whom we prepare for her final exit today, has these important answers. Death is unimaginable without understanding the concept and purpose of life. We lived with our Heavenly father before we come to Earth. Our journey in mortality is to prepare to meet God. Our life has a purpose and plan. The summary of life is to find lasting peace and happiness. She found that peace, she gave us that peace, she lived that peace and she died with that peace. 
            <h2>BIRTH AND PARENTAGE:</h2>
            Sister Caroline M. Arungwa {nee – Caroline Johnson} was born in September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two (1952) to the family of Chief & Lolo Mrs Johnson Iromaka. She was the only surviving child of her mother.
            <h2> EDUCATION AND TRAINING:</h2>
            She received a basic formal education and proceeded to learn tailoring which she continued to practice after her marriage. She was active in several cooperative societies in Nigeria and used her access to create awareness with the support of her husband. She further ventured into trading and was renowned as a dealer in all kinds of food stuffs.
            <h2>CONVERSION TO THE TRUE CHURCH:</h2>
            Behind every successful man they say is a good woman, sister Caroline M. Arungwa stood side by side with the husband to ensure he got the full attention of the Lord in the ministry. She was a virtuous and religious person who does not turn away from the truth. She was a strict devoted Christian and a lover of Godly things. Her membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of latter- day saints attest to her desire to follow the truth. On the 13th of June 1985, sister Caroline M. Arungwa together with her husband and twenty-seven members of his Church were baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Though she held several positions in the church, but her remarkable attribute was being supportive of her spouse in the ministry.
           <h2> FAMILY LIFE:</h2>
            She got married to my grand-dad late Bishop M. A. N Arungwa of Umuahia South LGA of Abia State in September 1969. The union was blessed with nine (9) children four sons and five daughters. And they later sealed their marriage at Aba Nigeria Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
            <h2>SALIENT ATTRIBUTES AND GIFTS:</h2>
            She had a unique voice that echoes through eternities. She WAS a woman of peace and sought to please the Lord. In the words of President Joseph F. Smith – “Good Conduct Leads to Self-Respect, Which Creates Purity of Thought and Action”. She was respected among her friends. Those who had dealings with her would attest to her character. She affected and touched the lives of many. She exhibited leadership qualities in all her endeavours and relationship with others. Permit me to conclude this biographyas I recite this short verse by Attilio Bertolucci for my grandmother:
            <h3>“Invoked every sundown, it’s you, painted on clouds
            rouging our treasured plain and all who walk it,
            with leaf-fresh kids and women damp from traveling,
            city-bound, in the radiance of a just-stopped shower;
            it’s you, mother eternally young, courtesy of death’s
            plucking hand, rose at the fragrant point of unpetaling,
            you who are the alpha of every neurosis, every torturing anxiety,
            and for this I give you gratitude for time past, time present, time future”.</h3>
            
            Adieu our dear Matriarch, leader, mother, grand-mother, and friend.
            Granny is survived by eight (8) children, twenty-three (23) grandchildren, three sons-in-law, and four (4) daughters-in-law
